## <span style="font-size:larger;">Graph Factorization in Julia</span>

### <span style="font-size:larger;">Overview</span>

This Julia code implements an algorithm to find {k, k+1}-factors in graphs. A {k, k+1}-factor is a subgraph in which each vertex has degree either k or k+1. This is a crucial concept in graph
theory with applications in various domains, such as network design and optimization.
